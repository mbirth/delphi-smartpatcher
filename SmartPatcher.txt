SmartPatcher by riddick
=======================

P U R P O S E

Let's say, you have downloaded a cracked version of CoolApp 1.0. You have the
original program file CoolApp.exe and a cracked one CoolApp.cracked.exe . But
now there's version 1.2 out and you don't have a crack for it. What do you do?

SmartPatcher is the solution! It analyzes the changes made by the cracker to
the v1.0 files and tries to apply the same changes to the new file. This works
with *almost any* application if the versions don't differ too much.



U S A G E

Staying with the previously created example, you would select your original
CoolApp.exe of version 1.0 as the "Original file", the cracked one as "Modified
file" and the new version 1.2 of CoolApp.exe as "New file". Now click on
"SmartPatch!" and take a look at the Messagebox. If you see some error lines
about not finding the appropriate location, try to check "Extended Search" on
your next try. (Restore the backup first.) Extended Search will do some more
searching which could take much longer with huge files.

Although it worked in most cases for me, there can be files where it doesn't.
Be warned that you use this software on your own risk. If you damage your
files, your computer or whatever - don't blame me.
